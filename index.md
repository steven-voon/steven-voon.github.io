I bridge the gap between complex spatial technology and intuitive user experiences. With a background in technical architecture and a focus on Augmented Reality, I build scalable solutions that transform how people interact with the digital and physical world.

Currently exploring: High-fidelity WebAR and GPS-integrated digital trails.
